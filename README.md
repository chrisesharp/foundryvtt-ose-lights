# foundryvtt-ose-lights

## Light source module for OSE

I wrote this as a module just for personal use that was very specifically designed for use with the fabulous [OSE](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ose) system in Foundry VTT, and more specifically, the items in the [OGL Content](https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques/foundryvtt-ose-content) that appears no longer to be maintained.

I offer it as-is.
